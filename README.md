# expense_analysis
This is an ongoing project using Jupyter notebooks, pandas, and matplotlib. 
The program involves data cleaning and visualization of household expenses. 
Some of the insights include spending per month, category of purchase, and average spend per item. 
I am currently working on improving the program by using lingear regression to explore the association between variables such as average tempreture and power spending. 
I look forward to pushing new changes soon!
